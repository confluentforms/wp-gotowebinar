                                <div>
                                    Just use this shortcode: <code>[gotowebinar]</code>. This shortcode will display all of your upcoming GoToWebinars. However you can put options into the shortcode like: <code>[gotowebinar include="" exclude="" hide="" timezone="" days=""]</code>. Just place a word or phrase in the include option to only show webinars that contain that word or phrase in the webinars title - the same goes for the exclude option. So to show all webinars that have a title that contains <strong>Training</strong> but excludes webinars that have the word <strong>Introduction</strong> you would use this shortcode: <code>[gotowebinar include="Training" exclude="Introduction"]</code>. Please note that what you type in these filters is case sensitive. You can also use the <strong>hide=""</strong> parameter to hide words/phrases from the title of the webinar. This can be a handy feature if you want to want to hide the <strong>include</strong> word or phrase from actually showing in the table. Using the <strong>days=""</strong> parameter you can get webinars from a certain amount of days in the future. For example <code>[gotowebinar days="10"]</code> will only show webinars that are coming up in the next 10 days. This can be handy if you have a large volume of webinars. You can also show webinars that are from a particular timezone, this can be handy if you have an American website but you only want to show webinars from your American office in New York. This can be done using <code>[gotowebinar timezone="America/New_York"]</code>. A list of these timezone filters can be found below:

                                    <p>You might now be asking how do I get my webinar key?

                                <div>Lucky you, we created a shortcode just for you! Just put this on any post or page: <code>[gotowebinar-reg key="upcoming"]</code>.

                                <div>The registratiom form fields shown by WP GoToWebinar mirrors the registration form fields you setup when creating the webinar on the GoToWebinar website. So you can include fields, make them required or not, or even add your own questions by going to the GoToWebinar website. Just remember if you make changes to your questions to clear the cache by pressing the "Clear Webinar Cache" button in the <a class="open-tab" href="#clear-cache">Clear Cache</a> tab. The cache is cleared automatically every 24 hours or when the next day starts but you may want to see the changes immediately so that's why we included the button!

                                    You will find the GoToWebinars widget on your <a href="widgets.php">widget page</a>. You can add multiple widgets with different filter criteria as well as setting a maximum number of webinars to display.

                                        <li>Go to your page or post and click on the Backend Editor button if you aren't in the Visual Composer mode yet.</li>
                                        <li>Under "Content" you will find WP GoToWebinar content elements, some of which contain additional settings.</li>

                                <div>
                                    At this point of time unfortunately you can't do something like: <code>[gotowebinar include="Training, Introduction, New Features"]</code>. Doing this will only include webinars that contain the full phrase <strong>"Training, Introduction, New Features"</strong>. Of course you can use the <strong>include</strong> and <strong>exclude</strong> parameters together.

                                <div>So that you don't make too many API calls to GoToWebinar so they don't shut you off from the API and to make your upcoming webinars and registration forms load super fast we have implemented caching. The caching will store your GoToWebinar data for 24 hours or when the next day starts. So if you have added a new webinar or you have changed the registration fields of a webinar this is why your changes aren't showing. It is generally recommended to keep the cache on, but you can turn it off by checking the "Turn Caching Off" checkbox on the <a class="open-tab" href="#general-options">General Options</a> tab. Or you can keep the cache on and just press the "Clear Webinar Cache" button found in the <a class="open-tab" href="#clear-cache">Clear Cache</a> tab.

                                <div><p>WP GoToWebinar has already made headings, hours/minutes and the days of the week translatable. I have already completed the following translations: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Chinese Tradition and Simplified and Hindi. So the WP GoToWebinar plugin will output the appropriate language  based on your main Wordpress language setting. If I have made an error in these translations please advise and I will update the plugin.</p>
                                    
                                <p>If there's no translation for your language please use the <a target="_blank" href="https://poedit.net/">Poedit</a> program which is free to create a translation in your language and share it with me and I will put it in the next release. You need to place your .mo and .po file in the <code>inc/lang</code> folder.</p>
                                    
                                <p>You can easily change the field names of the registration form fields and custom messages from the <a class="open-tab" href="#translation">Translation</a> tab.</p>

                                    <p>I have included a number of CSS classes and id's so if you're familar with CSS you can make a lot of cosmetic changes without having to go too crazy. There are many CSS plugins you can use to implement custom CSS on your site. Why not try out <a target="_blank" href="https://en-au.wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/">this one</a> I use. If you want to get more technical you can also use jQuery to make changes. I have also included a way you can customise the shortcodes and widget if you want to make some more full on structural changes to how things are displayed. You do need to know what you're doing to do this i.e. you need to know a bit about PHP and HTML.</p>   
                                    
                                    <p>All you need to do is create a folder in your current theme called <strong>wp-gotowebinar</strong> and copy and paste either the <strong>shortcode.php</strong> (upcoming webinar table), <strong>shortcode-registration.php</strong> (registration form) or <strong>widget-output.php</strong> (widget) files found in the WP GoToWebinar plugin folder into this new folder you created in your theme. You can then customise these files as you please and still receive plugin updates without your changes being overridden. I can't guarantee the compatibility of these custom files so you may need to update these custom files as the plugin changes.</p>
